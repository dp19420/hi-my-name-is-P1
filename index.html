                <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p> My first computer was given to me by my father at around the age of 2, it was his old computer bought in the late 70s.
                I can remember using some form of the application paint on it, however, it required some sort of tiny floppy disk, 2 of them at the same time if I remember correctly.
                You could only color 1 pixel at a time, and there was no save function.
                But a new world soon opened up to me with the release of 2 groundbreaking games, Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem 3D.
