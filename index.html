                <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p> My first computer was given to me by my father at around the age of 2, it was his old computer bought in the late 70s.
                I can remember using some form of the application paint on it, however, it required some sort of tiny floppy disk, 2 of them at the same time if I remember correctly.
                You could only color 1 pixel at a time, and there was no save function.
                But a new world soon opened up to me with the release of 2 groundbreaking games, Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem 3D.

                <h3>Growing up</h3>
            <p>
                Growing up i spent about equal time playing golf in the horse paddocks around my home as i did playin with computers.
                My father, having the fixation of having the latest technology of everything, i fixation i have iherited, brought home a new top of the line computer atleast every 2 years.
                placing the "old" one next to the new one for me to use.
                If i could tell you the amount of hours i've spent playing Red Alert or Football Manager it would probably lead you to question my tolerance for direct sunlight.
