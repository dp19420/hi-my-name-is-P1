            <h2>Hello and welcome to a page about me!</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring web and software developer just taking my first steps into this new world. 
                Or atleast a world that i have been close to all my life but never quite taken a true step towards.
                My father have worked as a it conultant for as long as i can remember, and i used to spen certain weeks of the summer holidays learning C++ at his workplace. 
                althou this was at the ages of about 6-9 s√• i suppose it was more playing, gaming and candy that really drew my interest! 
            </p>
            <p>
                On this, my first project website, I am to demonstrate to the best of my ability the basic skills and understanding i have achived so far.
                At the time of writing this is my first and only project on Github. But who knows, there might be more there at the time that you are reading this. Wouldent it be wonderful is the was i page filled with relevant links... There is! At the contact page.
